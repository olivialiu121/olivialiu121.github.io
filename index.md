<img src="https://lzl65825.github.io/olivia.jpg" class="floatpic" width="269" height="403">

Here is **Zelong Li**.

I received my Bachelor's in Computer Science and Technology at [Tsinghua University](https://www.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/). Currently, I am a Ph.D. Candidate majoring in Computer Science at [Rutgers University](https://www.cs.rutgers.edu/), with an expected graduation date in May 2024. I am working as a graduate assistant in the [**WISE Lab (Web Intelligent Systems and Economics)**](https://wise.cs.rutgers.edu/), advised by [Prof. Yongfeng Zhang](http://www.yongfeng.me/). Here is [my CV](https://lzl65825.github.io/file/CV_Zelong_Li.pdf).

I have over 15 years of coding experience. I wrote the LOGO language to get an award in a coding competition in 2007 as a fifth-grade primary school student. I started learning C++ in 2009 as a sixth-grade primary school student and later got multiple [awards](https://lzl65825.github.io/awards/) from high school coding competitions.
